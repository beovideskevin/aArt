# aArt

This is a JS app for creating ASCII art artworks: [aArt/](https://aart.eldiletante.com/). The images I created with it are in the gallery [eldiletante.com](https://www.eldiletante.com)

# BUGS

- [ ] when you switch apps several times the image from the canvas disappears and the config is reset. 

# TODO

- [ ] Save image as SVG, which will create a smaller file
