# aArt

I created this PWA to generate ASCII art artworks. I built it using only vanilla JS and added a worker for cache so the application works offline too.

The images I created are in the gallery [eldiletante.com](https://www.eldiletante.com)

# BUGS

- [ ] when you switch apps several times the image from the canvas disappears and the config is reset. 

# TODO

- [ ] Save image as SVG, which will create a smaller file
